                        In early 2001, 17 developers gathered near the Wasatch
                        Mountains in Snowbird, Utah, to discuss the future of
                        software development. The participants of this group
                        were united by concern about the current state of
                        affairs in the industry.

                        Problem - companies were paying too much attention to
                        over-planning and documenting everything. 12 principles
                        were united in a manifest 68 words. The essence of them
                        is in making the processes of product creation faster by
                        micro-planning, short production cycles and rapid
                        response to changes.

                            processes and tools should not limit them.

                            In Agile they decide for themselves how to change
                            the processes/tools of their work. To speed up the
                            development process, people should interact
                            directly. If they have a remote work - it is better
                            to use a videocall (not just chats).

                            software.” Product developers should focus precisely
                            on making sure that the product can be used as soon
                            as possible, and not on making lists, diagrams,
                            requirements, reports to the customer.

                            Being rigidly set at the start, the details of the

                            data and priorities that appear only during
                            development. In order for the business value of the
                            product to grow rapidly, the customer and the
                            developer must communicate closely in the course of
                            work. In this case, all changes and problems that
                            arise are promptly handled by both parties.

                            prepared for changes at all stages to avoid delaying
                            project risks until it is too late to make
                            adjustments.
